"""What a reader sees on a PDF page, read by pdfium (X8 report: "index only what the
page shows").

A word is visible when its centre lies on the page and drawing the page's text changes
the page inside its box (the page drawn with and without its text objects). Text that
draws nothing itself is a layer over another rendition of it (outlines, a scan) and is
visible where the page has ink. Clipped, covered, white and off-page text is not
visible. Docling reads such text, so its items keep only the words the page shows
(`keep_visible`); visible words Docling lacks are recovered (limespec.recovery).

Imported only when a PDF is read, so the API never needs the `ingest` group.
