"""Passages built from PDF readings (X9 report): the units searched, cited and quoted.

A reading (limespec.documents) holds a PDF's elements in reading order. On each page,
consecutive elements under the same section form a section (a heading starts one once
the current one holds more than headings, so stacked headings stay with the text below
them), and consecutive sections are packed into passages of at most MAX_PASSAGE_CHARS,
as element-based chunking merges small elements (X9 report). A table forms passages of
its own, in one of the forms experiment X9 compares; its cells are joined by " | ", a
mark that quote verification reads as a space. Running headers and footers stay out.
Each passage records its page and a context (section path, table caption, column
headers) that is searched and embedded with it but never quoted.
