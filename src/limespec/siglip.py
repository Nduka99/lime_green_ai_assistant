"""Pictures ranked by what they show: SigLIP2 so400m on the CPU (X43 B3, X44 F2).

Used as its model card shows: pictures through its processor (384 px), text padded to
SIGLIP_TEXT_TOKENS tokens and lowercased (SigLIP2 was trained on lowercased text, and
this checkpoint's Gemma tokenizer does not lowercase). Vectors are normalised, so a
dot product is the cosine. Picture vectors are made once, when pictures are read, and
stored with each picture; a question's vector is made at search time by the text
tower, loaded once per process. Needs torch and transformers.
