"""The retrieval steps shared by every index: fusion and reranking.

Two independent rankings are merged by reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF): keyword search
(BM25) finds exact terms such as product names, and vector search (cosine similarity
of embeddings) finds paraphrases; `store.search` runs both in Postgres. A
cross-encoder reranker then reads the question with each of the best fused
candidates and orders them, so the passages the model sees first are the most
relevant ones.
