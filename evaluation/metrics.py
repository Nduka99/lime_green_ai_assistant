"""Standard information-retrieval measures, computed from ranked passage ids.

Relevance is binary and comes from a frozen answer key: a passage is relevant to
a question part when it contains one of that part's evidence quotes. Each
function takes one ranked list and the relevant ids, so the same numbers can be
reproduced from the saved run and qrels files with any IR tool.
